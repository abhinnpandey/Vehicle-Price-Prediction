# Vehicle-Price-Prediction
## Dataset Overview

Over 10000 used cars scraped with Scrapy from Ebay-Kleinanzeigen. Fields of dataset are included: [autos_small.csv](https://github.com/abhinnpandey/Vehicle-Price-Prediction/blob/master/vehicle%20price%20prediction/autos_small.csv)

**The problem is to determine price of used cars.** In this project you will discover how you can predict the sentiment of movie reviews as either positive or negative in Python.
